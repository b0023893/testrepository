	<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation 		Proclamation.</p> 	<p>This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro 	slaves 	who had been 	seared in the</p> 	<p>flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to 	end the 	long night of captivity. But one 	hundred </p>	<p>years later, we must face the tragic fact that 	the Negro 	is still not free.</p>
